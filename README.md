# React Express Auth

This example demonstrates how to:

-   connect your React frontend to Express backend and MongoDB
-   create user sessions using cookies
-   use global state and prop drilling
-   organize your app so that your code is maintainable
-   make your app prettier using Material UI ✨

Note: The JSON routes (`/students`) are *not* protected (no authentication required).  You can (and should!) add this using similar middleware techniques we used in lecture.

## Setup
Start your local Mongo database.  For example, in a separate terminal window:

```
# create and run local Mongo database in the root directory of the repo
mkdir mongo-data
mongod --dbpath mongo-data
```

Then, in the root directory of the repo, run:
```
# install server dependencies in the root directory
npm install

# install frontend dependencies in the client directory
cd client
npm install
```

Alternatively, you can run `npm run setup` in the root directory which runs a script to execute all the above commands (not including starting the mongo database, since it should be run in a separate window). This is a shortcut command defined in [package.json](package.json).

## Development

During development, run the following commands to build your React app and start the Express server.  You should re-run these commands for your app to reflect any changes in the code. Make sure mongo is still running on a separate terminal.

```
# build the React app
cd client
npm run build

# go back to the root directory
cd ..

# run the server
node server.js
```

Alternatively, you can run `npm run build-run` in the root directory which runs a script to execute all the above commands. This is a shortcut command defined in [package.json](package.json).

## Creating a User

There is no frontend form to create a user on the app, so before you login send a `POST` request to `/users` with something like:
```
{
    "email": "bob@gmail.com",
    "password": "123456"
}
```
Then proceed to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser and login with your credentials.

## React Components

Each React component lives in a separate directory with its own `index.js` and `styles.css`. Import them from parent components as needed.

### Styles

Unique styles associated with each React component are kept separate. If the same styles are shared between multiple React components, keep them in a top-level, shared CSS file (i.e. App.css) to avoid repeated styles.

### Material UI

The following Material UI components are used in this app:

-   Button
-   TextField
-   Grid
-   Table
-   Table Body
-   Table Row
-   Table Cell

You can find more components [here](https://material-ui.com/).

Note that you can override the default styles of these components by increasing CSS selector specificity.

### Actions

To keep your `index.js` files clean and simple, import required methods from an associated action file. Following this structure can help organize your code and keep it manageable.

## Deployment

The `start` and `heroku-postbuild` scripts included in [package.json](package.json) will tell Heroku how to run your app.  You can deploy to Heroku easily:

```
# create a new empty Heroku app in the root directory (only need to be done once)
heroku create

# deploy the latest committed version of your code to Heroku
git push heroku master
```

Don't forget to set the `MONGODB_URI` environmental variable to use a cloud Mongo database (like Atlas).
